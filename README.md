# Budget Tracker
A simple budget tracking application, build from HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, that can track income and expenses and update a remaining balance.

Features:
- Forms to add income and expenses
- Summary section that displays total income, expenses, and remaining balance
- Dynamic table that adds rows based on income and expense inputs

To run this application, you can either deploy the index.html file or click the deploy link in github actions.

*As of right now, this application does not have to ability to store information after refreshes. This is being worked on in its own branch and will be deployable eventually.*
